# README

Please find the "need to know" information below:

* Written in Ruby 2.3.1p112 with Rails 5.0.1 framework

* RSpec unit tests

* To install all dependencies, run 'bundle install' in the terminal. If you do not have Bundler installed, run 'gem install bundler' first.

* To run unit tests, run 'rspec' in the terminal.

* To view locally...
  1. Initialize, create, and seed database by running 'rails db:create,' then 'rails db:migrate,' then 'rails db:seed' in the terminal.
  2. Run 'rails s' in the terminal to launch the server.
  3. Type in 'localhost:3000' in your browser's url.
  4. I seeded it so there are 100 colas, 0 chips, and 5 candies.

* Note: I reset commits made between January 16-17, which is why it may look like I performed the same work twice. I did comment under each commit that was reset. [I wrote a blog post about my mistake of not branching during this project.](https://medium.com/@alxsanborn/source-control-in-github-f8610fd306f3#.p51dmopih)
